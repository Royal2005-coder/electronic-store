# Cart Functionality and Checkout Process Implementation Plan

**I. Understanding the Existing Codebase:**

1.  **Review `src/contexts/CartContext.tsx`:** Understand how the cart context is currently implemented. Identify the methods available for adding, removing, and updating cart items.
2.  **Review `src/app/cart/page.tsx`:** Understand how the cart page is currently implemented. Identify how cart items are displayed and how the total price is calculated.
3.  **Review `src/types/index.ts`:** Understand the `CartItem` type definition.

**II. Implementing Cart Functionality:**

1.  **Ensure `addToCart` function in `src/contexts/CartContext.tsx` correctly adds items to the cart:** Verify that the `addToCart` function is working as expected.
2.  **Implement `removeFromCart` and `updateCartItem` functions in `src/contexts/CartContext.tsx`:** If these functions are not already implemented, implement them.
3.  **Update `src/app/cart/page.tsx` to display cart items and calculate the total price:** Ensure that the cart page displays all cart items and correctly calculates the total price.
4.  **Add a "Checkout" button to `src/app/cart/page.tsx`:** Add a button that redirects the user to the checkout page.

**III. Implementing Checkout Process:**

1.  **Create a new page `src/app/checkout/page.tsx`:** This page will contain the checkout form.
2.  **Create a checkout form in `src/app/checkout/page.tsx`:** The form should collect the user's shipping address, payment information, and other necessary details.
3.  **Implement form validation in `src/app/checkout/page.tsx`:** Ensure that the form is properly validated before submitting.
4.  **Implement a function to process the order:** This function will take the user's information and create a new order in the database.
5.  **Redirect the user to an order confirmation page:** After the order is processed, redirect the user to a page that confirms their order.

**IV. Database Integration:**

1.  **Create an `Order` model:** This model will store the order information in the database.
2.  **Update the order processing function to save the order to the database:** The order processing function should save the order information to the database using the `Order` model.

**V. Payment Processing:**

1.  **Integrate a payment gateway:** Use a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal to process payments.
2.  **Update the order processing function to process the payment:** The order processing function should process the payment using the payment gateway.

**VI. Order Confirmation:**

1.  **Create a new page `src/app/order-confirmation/[orderId]/page.tsx`:** This page will display the order confirmation information.
2.  **Implement the order confirmation page:** The page should display the order ID, the user's information, the order items, and the total price.

**VII. Testing:**

1.  **Test the cart functionality:** Ensure that items can be added, removed, and updated in the cart.
2.  **Test the checkout process:** Ensure that the checkout form is properly validated and that the order is processed correctly.
3.  **Test the payment processing:** Ensure that payments are processed correctly.
4.  **Test the order confirmation page:** Ensure that the order confirmation page displays the correct information.
